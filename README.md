# KNN-algorithm

This project involves the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python, utilizing the Pandas and NumPy libraries for efficient data manipulation.The analysis is conducted on a diabetes dataset. The workflow includes the initial separation of input and output data, subsequent application of train-test splitting, and normalization of both the training and testing datasets. A KNN model is then created using the normalized training data, and predictions are made on the testing data. Finally, a comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted to assess the effectiveness of the KNN algorithm in the given context.
